Each of my snapshots are broken up by file and then function within the file.

I have done my best to only screenshot nodes that are entirely my own.
For every file I have worked in, I have also created a changelog that explains what I achieved along with a date stamped on it.

Let me know if you want a writeup to accompany each snapshot or group of snapshots.
