# Project description
Our team is making a 3D top-down turn-based role-playing video game named Rossliad: Kingdom of Shadows. 

Currently, our game features an exploration system, character system, combat system, a unique story,  using the Unreal Engine.

Our exploration system will allow players to interact with the world to acquire items, talk with denizens of the world, and learn more about their environment.

Our character systems will allow played to customize their character with equipment, statistics and improve their power by leveling up.

Our combat system is inspired by Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition. We will include many familiar characteristics such as:
- Actions
- Dice Rolls for the outcome of Actions
- A number of weapons to choose from
- Turn-based combat with tiles for movement
- Different types of enemies with unique behaviors
- A unique final boss with special mechanics

Our story is a unique adventure based on a Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition campaign that two of our two members played in.

This game is built on the Unreal Engine version 5.0.3. This powerful 3D engine allows us to explore new tools and options not found in other game engines.

Ideally with these systems our team will be able to provide our players with an unique and entertaining experience.
