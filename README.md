# Project description
Our team has made a 3D top-down turn-based role-playing video game named Rossliad: Kingdom of Shadows. 

Currently, our game features an exploration system, character system, and combat system all of which was built using the Unreal Engine 5.0.3.

Our exploration system allows players to interact with the world to acquire items.

Our character system allows players to customize their character with equipment and become more powerful as they progress through the game.

Our combat system is inspired by Dungeons and Dragons fifth edition. We have include familiar features such as:
- Movement Actions, Main Actions, Bonus Actions
- Two special abilities and a magic spell attack
- Dice Rolls for the outcome of Actions
- A number of medieval weapons to choose from
- Turn-based combat with tiles for movement
- Different types of enemies with unique behaviors
- Six combat encounters to progress through
- A final boss to defeat

This game is built on the Unreal Engine version 5.0.3. 
We chose this powerful 3D engine because it allows us to explore new tools and options not found in other game engines.

With these features we our team have ideally provided our players with an unique and entertaining gameplay experience.
